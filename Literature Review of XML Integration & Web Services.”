Literature Review on Web Services and XML Integration
by: Lawrence Heras

Goal:
   The primary objective of this literature review is to compare web services and XML integration to make a comparative analysis. focusing on their advantages, best practices, and real-world applications. 
    Web services and XML play a critical role in modern software architecture by enabling interoperability and data exchange across heterogeneous systems.

Role:
   A researcher analyzing existing studies, journal articles, and technical documentation.

Audience:
   Instructors, professionals software developer and students.

Situation:

      I am tasked to write a literature review on Web Services and XML in their roles in interoperability.
      My task now is to read through the available academic papers and technical literature to compare these two technologies in detail.

   My research involves reviewing key technologies, including:
   
      Web Services: SOAP, REST, WSDL, UDDI
      XML Integration: XML, XSD, XSLT, DOM, SAX

      Using Sources such as:
      https://d.web.umkc.edu/di5x7/output/Paper%20Critique%20-%20Web%20Services.pdf
      https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-10876-5_5

   I am expected to present my findings to an audience of instructors, software developers, and students, summarizing the strengths
   and weaknesses of both technologies.
